\title{Detect Bilateral Asymmetry in 3D Landmark Data}
\usage{
detect_asymmetry_3D(file_path, output_base = "asymmetry_output")
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{Path to the input CSV file containing 3D landmark data. Required columns:
\code{Specimen}, \code{Landmark}, \code{Region}, \code{Midline}, \code{Side}, \code{X}, \code{Y}, \code{Z}.}

\item{output_base}{Optional base name for the output directory. Default is \code{"asymmetry_output"}.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
  \item{OutputFolder}{Path to the output directory where results are saved}
  \item{RegionResults}{A named list for each region containing:
    \code{MeanShape}, \code{GPA}, \code{Procrustes_ANOVA}, \code{PerSpecimenAsymmetry},
    \code{Mahalanobis}, and \code{PCA} objects}
}
}
\description{
This function performs region-wise bilateral asymmetry analysis on 3D landmark data.
It includes Procrustes superimposition, PCA, Mahalanobis distances, Procrustes ANOVA,
and visualization of asymmetry vectors and residuals. Outputs are saved in a timestamped
folder with region-specific subfolders.
}
\details{
This function mirrors only the non-midline landmarks along the X-axis for the right side.
It automatically separates landmarks by region and performs shape analysis and asymmetry
quantification within each region. Interactive 3D plots are saved as HTML widgets.
